    <p class="lede">The systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life-cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The systems development life-cycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.</p>

    <h5>Notes:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>A refactor, or scrubbing, should occur at the end of each phase to ensure that the final product delivery is not a bloated beast of obfuscated code and unused <b>'best practices'</b>.</li>
      <li>Never sacrifice making something excellent for the sake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</li>
