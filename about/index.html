    <h3>Currently engineering Software for <a href="http://glg.it">GLG</a>. Formerly Managing front-end development at <a href="http://twc.com">Time Warner Cable</a>.</h3>

    <p class="lede">Max Quattromani is a front-end developer living and working in Denver, CO. In a previous life, Max was an auto mechanic who woke up one day and realized that working from the neck down sucked. The tools were sold and a computer was purchased. The first project was a tire-sales website for a tire distribution company he was working for. It was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110817043157/http://tdidenver.com/">truly horrible website</a> (but hey, the clock still works!). But commited to honing the craft; he pressed on. A few freelance jobs later and he had landed a full-time gig as a Jr. Web Developer with a lip balm manufacturing company.</p>

    <p>As the skillset and passion grew, the right opportunity came along in the form of a contract with Time Warner Cable - this parlayed into a managers role and building a team of some of the finest coders this side of the Mississippi.</p>

    <p>Today, working as a self-employed freelancer, Max is developing the front-ends primarily for GLG and knocking out a few side projects along the way. Have a look around the site and if you have feedback, don't be shy.</p>

These days though, I typically do mile-marker checkins in Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer (back to IE8, let's not dwell on that fact).

    <p>This site was previously just an online resume holder, but I've decided that I have things to say and share so this seemed like the most logical place. I have also published my  <a href="/styleguide">style guide</a> and <a href="/patterns">pattern library</a> which are pet projects that I love to tweak and improve occassionaly; typically after I learn a new shiny thing.</p>
