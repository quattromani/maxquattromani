    <h3>Currently engineering Software for <a href="http://glg.it">GLG</a>. Formerly Managing front-end development at <a href="http://twc.com">Time Warner Cable</a>.</h3>

    <p>Max Quattromani is a front-end developer living and working in Denver, CO. In a previous life, Max was an auto mechanic who woke up one day and realized that working from the neck down sucked. The tools were sold and computer purchased. The first project was a tire-sales website for a tire distribution company he was working for. It was a truly horrible website. But commited to honing the craft; he pressed on. A few freelance jobs later and he had landed a full-time gig as a Jr. Web Developer and a lip balm manufacturing company.</p>

    <p>As the skillset and passion grew, the right opportunity came along in the form of a contract with Time Warner Cable - this parlayed into a managers role and building a team of some of the finest coders this side of the Mississippi.</p>

    <p>Today, working as a self-employed freelancer, Max is developing the front-ends primarily for GLG and knocking out a few side projects along the way. Have a look around the site and if you have feedback, don't be shy.</p>
