<h1>Front-End Developer/Designer</h1>

<article role="article">
  <section>
    <h3>Currently the Senior Director of Development for <a href="http://placewise.com">Placewise Media</a>. Formerly engineered Software for <a href="http://glg.it">GLG</a> and managed front-end development at <a href="http://twc.com">Time Warner Cable</a>.
    </h3>

    <p class="lede">Max Quattromani is a Senior Director and Front-End Developer living and working in Denver, CO. In a previous life, Max was an auto mechanic who woke up one day and realized that working from the neck down sucked. The tools were sold and a computer was purchased. The first project was a tire-sales website for a tire distribution company. It was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110817043157/http://tdidenver.com/">truly horrible website</a> (but hey, the clock still works!). But committed to honing the craft; he pressed on. A few freelance jobs later and he had landed a full-time gig as a Jr. Web Developer with a manufacturing company.</p>

    <p>As the skillset and passion grew, the right opportunity came along in the form of a contract with Time Warner Cable - this parlayed into a managers role and building a team of developers.</p>

    <p>Today, Max oversees development for a media agency and takes on a few side projects along the way. Have a look around the site and if you have <a href="contact">feedback</a>, don't be shy.</p>

    <h3>How I work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP690">MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) </a> - running Yosemite beta v10.11.1

      <li>
        <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is my editor of choice
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>: I tend to develop almost exclusively in Chrome at the start of projects. At one point I developed in Firefox exclusively. These days though, I typically do mile-marker checkins in Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer (back to IE9, let's not dwell on that fact).
