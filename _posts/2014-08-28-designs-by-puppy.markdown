Just a quick thought I had this morning: my puppy, Pixel, is the perfect user-testing subject. Pixel has pretty basic needs: feed me, shelter me, scratch my belly, be kind to me.

That's it.

Now I'm not comparing human-users to dogs, but human's needs and wants, at a basal level, are pretty simple. The scope of those needs are vast and varied, but once the need is established - we just want to get it met.

Too many times when designing something I find myself overcomplicating things, trying to "think ahead" of the way my users will interact with a component.

At the end of the day, the thing I'm building has to do the thing it was designed to do.

Everything else is superfluous. What <a href="http://www.gregstanforth.com/">my high school art teacher</a> would call "Visual Bullshit."

My designs tend to lean to the simplistic already, but when I tell people that I am usaully referring to the visual aesthetic. Pixel would agree that I need to be more simplistic when tackling the functionality as well.
